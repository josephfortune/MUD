How to handle world global scope, pass through constructors?

"someone has departed" type descriptions should perhaps be stored in the character objects

Do we need to separate functions moveplayerthroughexit and movecharacterthroughexit?

Players identify rooms by string instead of reference. Consider changing.

May not need MUTEX, check what synchronized keyword does

Theres a lot of static crap in the world object.

We need to make sure all class variables are private

The way in which listen threads are distributed does not look safe with the C style 256 roll over, and not even sure its necessary

Also not crazy about worldTimers floating around

Characters need short hand names for attacks and commands. example I dont want to have to type "kill A shaggy dog"

The delay timers for the triggerAriveAlert are really sketchy. Investigate

the playerSay function should probably changed to characterSay for more versatility

Consider making a function to getCharactersByRoom that includes both npcs and players to help eliminate the duplicate code

getRoomByPlayer() may be obsolete since the player maintians a reference to the room they are in
